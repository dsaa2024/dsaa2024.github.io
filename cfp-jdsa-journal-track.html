              <h5>JDSA special issue on Theoretical and Practical Data Science and Analytics</h5>
              <p>The journal track of the conference is implemented in partnership with Springer's International Journal of Data Science and Analytics (JDSA). The conference provides an international forum for the discussion of up-to-date high-quality research results in all areas related to Theoretical and Practical Data Science and Analytics. Accepted submissions to this journal track shall be published in special issues of JDSA, and the authors of the accepted submissions shall present their work at the journal track of IEEE DSAA 2024.</p>
              <h5>Topics & Eligibility</h5>
              <p>Papers on all the topics related to Theoretical and Practical Data Science and Analytics are invited. As a journal track, we accept only papers that meet the typical journal paper quality and, at the same time, are also appropriate for giving conference presentations. Papers addressing the interdisciplinary vision, position, review, theoretical and practical contributions to the theoretical aspects of data science and analytics (e.g., data science foundations and theories, mathematics and statistics for data science and analytics, data mining, machine/deep/statistical learning-based algorithms) and the practical aspects of data science and analytics (e.g., domain-specific data science and analytics practice and applications - such as business analytics, health/medical/biomedical analytics, financial analytics, and environmental analytics) are welcome. Journal versions of previously published conference papers must include substantially new content. Survey, position, and vision papers are also welcome for the journal track.</p>
              <p>Papers that do not meet these eligibility criteria may be rejected without formal review but can be transferred and resubmitted as regular papers to JDSA for review. Authors submitting their work to this journal track commit themselves to presenting their papers at IEEE DSAA 2024 if accepted.</p>
              <h5>Deadline</h5>
              <p>The Journal Track submission deadline is midnight AoE (Anywhere on Earth), April 15, 2024. Journal paper reviews typically take longer than conference paper reviews to complete, because many journal submissions require a second round of review after initial revisions are made. To ensure synchronized accept/reject decisions with the rest of the conference, Journal Track presentations to IEEE DSAA 2024 will be confirmed by JDSA before the review process is completed.</p>
              <h5>Review</h5>
              <p>We strive for a high-quality and efficient review process. Each submission to this journal track shall be reviewed by three experienced reviewers. As a conference journal track, we ensure a faster turn-around reviewing process than what a regular journal submission may take. Paper reviews will be handled on a first-come-first-review basis and we shall meet the target of reaching out the decisions for all the submissions to this journal track at the end of July 2024, to be synchronized with the decision announcement date of the conference track. For those of the submissions that are finally accepted but are unable to complete the review process before the targeted decision announcement date at the end of July, we shall confirm the decision for the journal track in IEEE DSAA 2024, and further handle the review within the JDSA process.</p>
              <h5>Submission and Publication</h5>
              <p>Please note that the journal track has a different submission system than the conference track. To submit to this track, authors must make a <a href="https://www2.cloud.editorialmanager.com/jdsa/default2.aspx" target="_blank">journal submission to JDSA</a>, and select the type of submission to be for the IEEE DSAA 2024 special issue. There is no page limitation for the journal track. Please follow the <a href="https://link.springer.com/journal/41060/submission-guidelines?IFA" target="_blank">author's instructions for JDSA</a> on the journal website.</p>
              <p>Each accepted JDSA paper will be published in JDSA, while a two-page extended abstract in the IEEE format following DSAA 2024 submission guide needs to be submitted to IEEE DSAA 2024 for inclusion to its conference proceedings under the section titled 'IEEE DSAA 2024 Journal Track with JDSA'. At least one author of an accepted journal track paper must register IEEE DSAA 2024 and present the paper at the conference.</p>
