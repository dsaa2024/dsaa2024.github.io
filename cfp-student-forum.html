              <h5>Description</h5>
              <p>The Student Forum at DSAA 2024 (DSAA-SF) is an initiative that endeavors to expand and enhance the participation of undergraduate and graduate students of diverse backgrounds in research on Data Science and Advanced Analytics. Towards that goal, the DSAA-SF will: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Provide a student research poster submission track which will be used to both provide critical feedback to students on their ongoing research projects and select a subset of students that will be provided financial assistance to attend and present their work at DSAA 2024.</li>
                <li>Organize student poster presentations at DSAA 2024, along with participating reviewers that will provide additional feedback on talks.</li>
                <li>Match participating students with academic and industry mentors that can provide them feedback on current or future research project ideas, along with overall career advice.</li>
                <li>Organize a panel focused on rewards and potential challenges of different research career pathways, including graduate school/PhD, research labs, and industry.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The DSAA-SF will accept poster submissions from only students (they should be the primary authors of the paper, and other authors and their advisor can be co-authors). Students exploring a career in data science research are encouraged to apply. Preference will be given to students who identify with groups traditionally underrepresented in the field of computing and/or students who have limited resources related to graduate school at their home institutions.</p>
              <p>Topics of interests include but are not limited to:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Data science foundations and theories</li>
                <li>Mathematics and statistics for data science and analytics</li>
                <li>Understanding data characteristics and complexities</li>
                <li>Machine/deep/statistical learning-based algorithms</li>
                <li>Advanced analytics and knowledge discovery methods</li>
                <li>Computer vision and pattern recognition</li>
                <li>Optimization theories and methods</li>
                <li>Large-scale databases, big-data processing, distributed processing, and ethical analytics</li>
                <li>Model explainability and provenance</li>
                <li>Theories and methods for evaluation, explanation, visualization, and presentation</li>
                <li>Survey and review</li>
                <li>Trustworthy and responsible data analytics</li>
                <li>Data analytics for social good</li>
              </ul>
              <h5>Target Audience</h5>
              <p>The aim of the DSAA-SF is to broaden the participation of undergraduate and graduate students with diverse backgrounds in computing and data mining research. Our goal is to engage and expose students in research pertaining to knowledge discovery from data by providing mentorship and support for the conference experience. We especially encourage underrepresented students in computing to apply, including but not limited to students from primarily undergraduate institutions, and students who have limited resources for research and graduate school at their home institutions.</p>
              <p>The target audience for the DSAA-SF is current undergraduate and graduate students who:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Have worked on a data science research project in one aspect of the data science lifecycle including but not limited to: data cleaning and preparation, data transformation, mining, inference, learning, explainability, data privacy, and dissemination of results.</li>
                <li>Have genuine interest in data science research.</li>
                <li>Are in need of support and feedback from a mentor and data science community for their interest in pursuing data science research after graduation.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Students who were not enrolled in an undergraduate or graduate program in the 2024-2025 academic year are not eligible for the Student Forum.</p>
              <h5>Important Dates</h5>

              </ul>
              <p>Accepted applicants who also attend the DSAA-SF will have their abstracts published by DSAA (online only, not in the proceedings). Additionally, a subset of the students may be invited to present their papers orally during the DSAA-SF, and all students will be invited to present their work in the form of a poster.</p>
              <h5>Financial Assistance</h5>
              <p>Some accepted applicants may receive some financial support towards attending the conference, in exchange for volunteering a few hours of their time at the conference. The maximum amount of support provided to each grantee is set by the sponsors (Elsevier AI Journal, NSF), and they are intended to partially cover the grantee’s expenses. Travel may or may not be partially covered depending on the total availability of funds and the number of awards given.</p>
              <h5>Acknowledgments</h5>
              <p>Support for the 2024 DSAA Student Forum is graciously provided by the Elsevier Artificial Intelligence Journal, and the National Science Foundation.</p>
